Function
========
1. Pre-defined (The functions are alredy written, we just have to use them)
 (console.log(),document.write(),window.alert(),Math.max())
2. User defined (We have to declare the function & use)


a. Function Declaration  (Named Function)
b. Function Expression   (Anonymous Function)
c. Self Invoked       (Immedidately Invoked function Expression- IIFE)
d. Arrow Function ( ECMASCRIPT - 4 )

Regular Function : 'this' is dynamic , it changes
                   where/how the function is called
Arrow Function :  'this' is not dynamic , doesn't have its own this
                   where the function is written
