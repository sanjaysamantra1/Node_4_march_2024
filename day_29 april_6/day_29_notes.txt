HTTP Module
===========
-The HTTP module can create an HTTP server.
-Receives the request from client & gives a response back to the client.


-headers, URL, method and body data can be collected from request objects.
-Make routing decisions based on URL and/or other data in request objects.
-Send headers, HTTP status codes and body data via response objects.

createServer()   		Returns a new instance of Server.
listen(PORT,CallBack)   Binds the server to listen on a specific port
close()					Stops the server from listening to more requests

response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
response.writeHead() should be called first when initiating a response, allows 	us to set up the HTTP response code and headers we are sending back.

response.write(chunk[, encoding][, callback]) allows us to send a chunk of data as part of our response.

response.end() signalizes the response as complete, MUST be called once per response.


Note:Unless you change the path to your favicon in an HTML document, browsers will (usually) make a request to the /favicon.ico path in order to get the favicon of your server.


HTTP Methods
