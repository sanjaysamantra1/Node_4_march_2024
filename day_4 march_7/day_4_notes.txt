use strict
==========
-'use strict' is used to execute javascript code in strict mode.
-when strict mode is enabled, mistakes are converted to errors
-in normal mode there are few mistakes they are ignored
-'use strict' should be at the top of the script / top of the function

Rules:
=====
-variable declaration without var/let/const is not allowed
-Duplicate parameter name not allowed
-we cannot use delete operator for non deleteable things



Hoisting
========
-The process of assigning variable declarations a default value of 'undefined' during the creation phase, is called hoisting.
-in hoisting, the variables and functions are put into memory during the creation phase
-assignment of undefined value is done only for var variables

-Javascript code gets executed in 2 phases
    1. memory creation (variables,functions are stored in memory)
    2. code execution  (actual execution)


Temporal DeadZone
================
its state where the variable is there in memory, but we cann't use that variable
