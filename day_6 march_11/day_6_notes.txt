Function Curring
================
-Function Currying is a concept of breaking a function with many arguments into many functions with single argument in such a way, that the output is same. 
-its a technique of simplifying a multi-valued argument function into single-valued argument multi-functions.
-It helps to create a higher-order function. It is extremely helpful in event handling.

	var add = function (a){
                 return function(b){
                       return function(c){
                                 return a+b+c;
                              }        
                        }
                  }
	console.log(add(2)(3)(4)); //output 9



Pure Function
=============
-Pure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without 
 modifying any data outside its scope(Side Effects). 
 
-A function is called pure if that follows the below 3 standards
	1. Pure functions shouldn't update the data outside it's scope.
	2. pure functions must return a value.
	3. Its output or return value must depend on the input/arguments.




Higher-order Function
=====================
-Higher-order function is a function that may receive a function as an argument and/or can even return a function. 
-a function can be called as a Higher-order if that function has either of the below 2 abilities:
	1. a function has ability to return another function.
	2. a function has ability to take another function as argument.
-Array filter(),map(),reduce(),sort() are some of the Higher-Order functions.



function recursion
==================
-A recursive function is a function that calls itself until the program achieves the desired result.
-A recursive function should have a condition that stops the function from calling itself.otherwise, 'RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded'  error will be thrown
-A recursive function can be used instead of a loop where we don't know how many times the loop needs to be executed.

ex: function countDown(fromNumber) {
		console.log(fromNumber);
		let nextNumber = fromNumber - 1;
		if (nextNumber > 0) {
			countDown(nextNumber);
		}
	}
	countDown(5);



Memoization
===========
-Memoization is a programming technique that attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results.
-Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
-its a kind of caching the data.
-used with recursion.
